Permission
**********

``MACHINA_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATED_USER_FORUM_PERMISSIONS``
--------------------------------------------------------

Default: ``[]``

*Django-machina* relies on a permission system based on per-forum permissions. This allows you to define which permissions should be applied for each forum, for each user and for each group of users. However you might want to not have to deal with complex permissions and grant the same basic permissions to all the users and for all the forums you created. In that case, this setting can be used in order to define which permissions should be granted to all authenticated users. Note that the permissions specified in this list are granted only if the considered forum does not have any permission for the considered authenticated user. For example, the setting could be specified as follows::

	MACHINA_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATED_USER_FORUM_PERMISSIONS = [
	    'can_see_forum',
	    'can_read_forum',
	    'can_start_new_topics',
	    'can_reply_to_topics',
	    'can_edit_own_posts',
	    'can_post_without_approval',
	    'can_create_polls',
	    'can_vote_in_polls',
	    'can_download_file',
	]

For a full list of the available forum permissions, please refer to :doc:`forum_permissions`.

.. warning::

  Keep in mind that the permissions specified in the ``MACHINA_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATED_USER_FORUM_PERMISSIONS`` list will be automatically granted for authenticated users if the targetted forum has no other permissions for these users. This behavior will apply if you create a new forum without a specific permission configuration ; so be careful with the permission code names you put in this setting.
