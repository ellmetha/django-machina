If this option is set to `True`, posts will have three approval states `True` (approved), `None`
(pending approval), and `False` (disapproved). Posts with approval status `None` will be moderated,
and be assigned to states `True` or `False`. Disapproved posts are not deleted, allowing them to be
revised and re-posted.

be counted towards `posts_count` and be displayed. Otherwise, pending posts will not be displayed until
they are approved.

This option is only valid when `MACHINA_TRIPLE_APPROVAL_STATUS` is set to `True`.


Permission
**********

``MACHINA_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATED_USER_FORUM_PERMISSIONS``
--------------------------------------------------------

Default: ``[]``

Django-machina relies on a permission system based on per-forum permissions. This allows you to
define which permissions should be applied for each forum, for each user and for each group of
users. However you might want to not have to deal with complex permissions and grant the same basic
permissions to all the users and for all the forums you created. In that case, this setting can be
used in order to define which permissions should be granted to all authenticated users. Note that
the permissions specified in this list are granted only if the considered forum does not have any
permission for the considered authenticated user. For example, the setting could be specified as
follows:

.. code-block:: python

    MACHINA_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATED_USER_FORUM_PERMISSIONS = [
        'can_see_forum',
        'can_read_forum',
        'can_start_new_topics',
        'can_reply_to_topics',
        'can_edit_own_posts',
        'can_post_without_approval',
        'can_create_polls',
        'can_vote_in_polls',
        'can_download_file',
    ]

For a full list of the available forum permissions, please refer to :doc:`forum_permissions`.

.. warning::

  Keep in mind that the permissions specified in the
  ``MACHINA_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATED_USER_FORUM_PERMISSIONS`` list will be automatically granted for
  authenticated users if the targetted forum has no other permissions for these users. This behavior
  will apply if you create a new forum without a specific permission configuration ; so be careful
  with the permission code names you put in this setting.
