Overriding application models
#############################

*Django-machina* allows you to override its models. This can be useful if you want to add new methods or new fields to existing *django-machina* models.

To illustrate this functionality, we will add an ``icon`` field to the ``Topic`` model (which is part of the ``forum_conversation`` app) in order to allow users select an icon for the topics they create.

Prerequisite
------------

Please ensure that you have correctly followed the instructions described in :doc:`../overriding_applications` before trying to override *django-machina* models. If so, you should have created a Python package with the same application label as the app you want to override. This new application should be defined in your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.

Most importantly, you should've created a ``models.py`` file inside your package in order to reference the models of the overriden application::

  # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

  from __future__ import unicode_literals

  # Custom models should be declared before importing
  # django-machina models

  from machina.apps.forum_conversation.models import *  # noqa

Finally you should have copied the content of the ``migration`` folder from the application you want to override into your own local application.

Defining a new custom model
---------------------------

In order to define a new version of an existing *django-machina* model you have to define a new class that subclasses the abstract model class of the model you want to override. The new model you define must have the exact same name as the model you are trying to override.

For example, in order to define a custom version of the ``Topic`` model it is necessary to subclass the ``machina.apps.forum_conversation.abstract_models.AbstractTopic`` abstract model::

  # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

  from __future__ import unicode_literals

  from django.db import models
  from machina.apps.forum_conversation.abstract_models import AbstractTopic

  # Custom models should be declared before importing
  # django-machina models

  class Topic(AbstractTopic):
      icon = models.ImageField(verbose_name="Icon", upload_to="forum/topic_icons")

  from machina.apps.forum_conversation.models import *  # noqa

.. note::

    You need to ensure that the import of *django-machina*'s models is always done at the bottom of your ``models.py`` file. This is very important in the event that you define overridden models because it will ensure that your overriden models will be loaded by Django instead of the original versions provided by *django-machina*.

Creating migrations
-------------------

As stated previously, you should've copied the content of the ``migration`` folder from the application you want to override into your own local application. Then you just have to create a new migration related to the changes you made to the overriden models:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ django-admin makemigrations forum_conversation
